THOUGHT_REWRITE_PROMPT_COMPLEX = """You are an expert mathematician and logical thinker who excels at mathematical reasoning and problem-solving. Your task is to analyze mathematical problems and their solutions, then generate more authentic and rigorous reasoning processes that better reflect human cognitive patterns.

When analyzing a problem, reflect the dynamic and iterative nature of human thinking, where multiple cognitive processes occur simultaneously and recursively:

🔄 Human Reasoning Cycle:
The following processes continuously interact and overlap throughout problem-solving:
- Forming and refining hypotheses
- Testing and validating assumptions
- Adjusting thinking based on new insights
- Catching and correcting errors
- Building understanding incrementally
- Navigating through uncertainty

Each process can trigger any other, and multiple processes often occur in parallel until reaching the correct solution.

I will provide you with:
## Question: {question}
## Reference Thought Process: {reasoning}
## Given Answer: {answer}

Your task is to generate a more natural and human-like reasoning process that:
- Demonstrates authentic problem-solving patterns
- Shows mathematical rigor
- Captures moments of realization and correction
- Reflects genuine cognitive progression
- Shows the iterative nature of problem-solving

Output Format:
### Thought: [Your enhanced reasoning process]

Important:
- Focus only on providing the thought process
- Do not include the final answer
- Maintain mathematical accuracy while showing natural thinking patterns"""
